On Windows:

Virtual Memory:
	Process does not born with prefixed memory, but it demands it.
	Page file size is 4KB (4096 Bytes).

	X64 has TLB(Lookaside buffer) of 2MB.
	X84 has TLB(Lookaside buffer) of 4MB.

	Commited: Memory size in use.
	Reserved: Memory size reserved for future use - cannot be allocated. It can be committed but not allocat it again.

Memory types:
	Private - data which is used only by the process. (Every process has a heap).
	Shareable - shared memory. Other process can use that memory. Example - image like .EXE, .DLLs.
	
Task Manager (In Windows) only shows the private bytes.

Swapped Memory:
	The memory amount which is "swapped". Memmory is swapped in case there is no sufficient space in RAM and memory is stored in the disk.
