Docker mount:
	I was trying to run my tasker-planner on a container. The database is mounted to one of the directories in my Windows local machine in that way:
		docker run -it -v "%local_database_path%":/app/mounted-data tasker-planner:%id%

	local_database_path - was my path in my windows machine I work with
	/app/mounted-data = the path inside the container that the database files should exist.

	After running the docker with the -v mounting command above, my application that run in the container failed to find directory /mounted-data/plans
		while it already had that directory! For a proof, I had to go into the running container, puting 'ls' I have found /mounted-data/plans directroy.
		Weird... In the time, my mounted directory from windows, let's say it was "C:/Users/Me/tasker-planner/", had no directories inside. The application did not crushed after I manually added the "plans" directory in my Windows machine. So as I understand, mounting container with -v command kind of making the conatiner ignore all the real paths inside the container that related to the mount.


When kubernetes in docker desktop does is starting forever, do the next:
	delete C:\Users\DorShaar\AppData\Local\Docker\pki (create backup just in case)
	delete "C:\Users\DorShaar\.kube" (create backup just in case)
