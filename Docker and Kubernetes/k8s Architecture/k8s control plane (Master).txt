The control plane is assembled from 4 components:

kube-api-server
kubve-controller-manager
kube-scheduler
etcd

When Worker Node would like to communicate with the Master Node, i.e. the control plane, it is beeing done via the kube-api-server. That is the only component the is public from the control plane.

etcd:
Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetesâ€™ backing store for all cluster data.

kube-scheduler:
Control Plane component that watches for newly created pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.

Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference and deadlines.

kube-control-manager:
Runs controllers processes, which include:
	Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
	Replication Controller: Responsible for maintaining the correct number of pods for every replication controller object in the system.
	Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins Services & Pods).
	Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.
