What is Ingress?
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an object that allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. You configure access by creating a collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services. This lets you consolidate your routing rules into a single resource.

You must have an ingress controller to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

The ingress controller is decided in the metadata.annotations section.


Example (based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VicH6KojwCI):
Lets say we have have online store, with service of 3 pod of wearing, and another services of 3 pods of video streaming.
each of the services type is exported by load balancer. It looks like that

	www.my-online-store.com
							/wearing -> load-balancer-1
							/video   -> load-balancer-2
							
			-------------->load-balancer<------------
			|										|
		load-balancer-1						load-balancer-2
			^										^
			|										|
		Exported by port 38080				Exported by port 38282

		WearService (LoadBalancer)			videoService (LoadBalancer)


WearPod1	WearPod2	WearPod3	VideoPod1	VideoPod2	VideoPod3


In What ingress help us?

Ingress may replace the load-balancing, the application may look like that:

www.my-online-store.com

				-------------->INGRESS<--------------

			WearService						videoService


WearPod1	WearPod2	WearPod3	VideoPod1	VideoPod2	VideoPod3
