Initialize a directory as reposetory:
	git init
	
Download / clone outer reposetory:
	git clone <reposetory path>

Create a new branch:

Move to a branch:
	git checkout <Branch>
	
Create and checkout a new branch:
	git checkout -b <NewBranch>

	git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
	
merge with no fast forward: 
	git merge <BranchToMerge> --no-ff
	Explanation: merges the <BranchToMerge> to the current branch.
	
Inspect the repository history:
	git log --oneline --graph --branches --decorate
	
Revert (Undo without delete):
	git revet <commit hash number> -new
	
Reset (Undo with delete):
	git reset --hard HEAD~<n>, while <n> is the number of commits to go back.
