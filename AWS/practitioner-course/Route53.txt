Route53 is a manaaged DNS service which perform several things:

It perform DNS routing, means it provide an IP from a given url (like DNS should...)
1. 	Web Browser -> foo.example.com -> Route53
				<- A: 11.22.33.44

2. Weighted Routing Policy - It does sort of load balancing.
	If we have 3 different instances, with the following whights: 70, 20, 10, that means
	Route53 service will make sure to split the traffic between each instance in percentages of 70, 20, 10.

3. Latency Routing Policy - Route53 will make sure to provide the IP that is the most close to the client.

4. Failover Routing Policy - Route53 will make sure to perform healthchecks on the primary instance, and 	if it fails it should provide the IP of the failover (backup) instance.
