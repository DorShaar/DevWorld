AWS region:
        A region is a geographic area that consists of different Availability Zones.
        Each region has at least 3 abailabilities zones, maximum of 6.
        Choosing a region is depends on
                - Regulations (let's say a limitiation of a country to store the data only on it's region)
                - Latency - if most of the customers are in region x (Let's say america..), it is prefered to use such region, otherwise network latency will occur and
                        it will lead to lags on the application.

AZ - Availability Zone:
        Distinct location from within AWS region that is engineered to be isolated from failures.
