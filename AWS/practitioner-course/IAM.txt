IAM - Identity and Access Management

Policies may be given to a group, so user will be provided with a policy according to it's groups
Policies also may be given to a user without a group, it called inline policy.

Q: What will be the outcome for a case in aws on IAM service, user is found in a group that allows getting objects from bucket "games" and also found in a group that does not allow getting object from bucket "games"?
A: In AWS IAM, Explicit Deny takes precedence over any Allow permission. This means that even though the user is in a group that allows access to the "games" bucket, the Deny permission from the other group will override that Allow permission.

Always remember that in IAM:
* Allow permissions grant access unless there is an explicit Deny.
* Explicit Deny will always override Allow permissions.


Console:
aws iam list-users --profile dor-aws will provide all users information.

To see all profiles, open "C:\Users\<user-name>\.aws\config"
