WMF, or Windows Metafile, is the original 16-bit metafile format. It is the native vector graphics format for the Microsoft Windows platform.
It is also the standard format for scalable graphics in Microsoft Office and many other Windows applications.
Even though it has been enhanced and extended as a 32-bit format (EMF -Enhanced Metafile), WMF is still the most widely used and supported metafile format on the Windows platform.

EMF and WMF contain predefined records, which the image is drawn according to those records.
