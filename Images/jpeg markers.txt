Image metadata structure - markers: They are, as their names, markers, that holds information about the image.
From https://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/wiki/The_Metadata_in_JPEG_files:
	A JPEG file contains several segments; each segment contains different kinds of data, delimited by two-byte codes called markers.
	The markers are hexadecimal; they begin with 0xFF and end with a code (1 byte) indicating the kind of marker.
	
	Some markers consist of just those two bytes; others are followed by two bytes indicating the length of marker-specific payload data that follows.
	The length includes the two bytes for the length, but not the two bytes for the marker.
