The problem - Pull request and code reviews are found to be the main bottleneck in the development process.
From a podcast I listen to in Dev Interuppted I summarize:

	Ship - Don't let birocratics ruin the flow of development process. If you are confident with the change
		and have good test coverages for that feature - ship it, push it to the branch.

	Show - Extends the Ship phase, you should open PR if you think it will beneficial to share the change, show it,
		to others to improve share knowledge. Still, you can push to your branch without waiting for the others.
	
	Ask - When you need or want to have a a review on your code. Even if you are confident about your change but
		you think some other developers can give their sight on the issue - this is the state where you should open
		and wait for PR.
