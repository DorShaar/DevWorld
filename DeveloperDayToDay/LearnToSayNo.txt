Sometimes the right response to a request is “No.” Maybe “Yes” and “No” are the wrong words, or the wrong responses,
	but the meaning is what we should deliever.
	
One of the teammates asks you for an help, instead of being rude and say "no", you can say something like:
	"I am flattered that you thought of me but I’m afraid I don’t have the bandwidth",
	"I would very much like to but I’m overcommitted"
	
Remember That A Clear “No” Can Be More Graceful Than A Vague Or Noncommittal "Yes" (McKeown).
	If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a vague or noncommittal “yes” situation, a clear “I am going to pass on this” 
	or  "I will try to make this work" or "I might be able to", only to be let down at the last minute. 
	Being vague is not the same as being graceful, and delaying the eventual "no" will only make it that much harder
	and the recipient that much more resentful.
		
When to say "no"?
	If the Product Owner expects them to deliver more than their capacity (on a daily basis..).
	If anyone asked you to deliver faster and it  violate the Definition of Done agreements. If faster, let's change the DOD first.
