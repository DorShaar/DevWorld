Kubernetes:
Problem: 
	Tried to deploy image from local docker repository, but got "Error: ImagePullBackOff" with next error message:
	Failed to pull image "active-mq:1.0": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: pull access denied for active-mq, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.

Solution:
	deployment was "imagePullPolicy: Always". Changing to "imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent" solved it.


PR comment:
	Double enumeration - when using LINQ, it easy to not paying attantion and make double enumeration. Example: Checking for any and right after that enumerat over the collection.
