Characters sets - declares what are the symbols we can use (show to the screen).
Encoding - the format, the rules of reading the bits.

If we look at text like "Jon uses ɡoogle" - we cannot deduce the Encoding of it.
We can guess that the encoding is ASCII, but the maybe one of the letters is taken not from the
ASCII table. In that example, the first ɡ is 0261h (0010 0110 0001) while the second g is "reguler",
from the ASCII table with value 0067h (0110 0111). // TODO verify with which encoding that is possible.
