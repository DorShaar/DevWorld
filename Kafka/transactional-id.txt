What is the transactional.id?
The transactional.id doesn’t relate to a particular transaction. It is used to identify transactions from a specific producer. A producer that performs transactions is known in the Kafka documentation as a “transactional producer”, and this is what the transactional.id relates to. A producer could run for days, or months, performing millions of transactions, and it will use the same transactional.id throughout. 

It enables transaction recovery across multiple sessions of a single producer instance. The transactional.id helps avoid “zombie producers” – a producer that was thought to have failed, or been deliberately killed, but is in fact still running. Kafka transactions enforce that only one producer is allowed to use a given transactional.id at a time. As a result, when Kafka sees the replacement producer, with the same transactional.id, it will “fence out” all interactions from the old one, disarming this zombie producer.


Case of two producers which has different transactional id:
Producer A, transactional id 1 - Writes A B C D
Producer B, transactional id 2 - Writes E F G H
Result Topic: A B C D E F G H

Case of two producers which has the same transactional id:
Producer A, transactional id 3 - Writes A B (Here producer B created with the same transactional id) C D
Producer B, transactional id 3 - Writes E F G H
What happens is that the former producer, A, is fenced out, so Kafka's brokers will not allow it to publish records C and D, and the records from the last commited producer, B, will be commited.
Result Topic: A B E F G H
