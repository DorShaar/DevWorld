Subnet mask are contiguous, meaning it start is bits of only 1's and then ends with bits of only 0s. Mask like 240.255.3.191
        (11110000.11111111.00000110.11000000) is not suppoted.

Subnet Mask examples:
    Example 1:
        Device1 with IP 10.1.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 sending message to device2 with ip 10.1.2.1.
        Thanks to the 255.255.0.0 mask it understands that device2 is in the same network, so it won't send the message to the router and send it
            directly to device2. It will send ARP message to request the MAC address of device2.

    Example 2:
        Device1 with IP 10.1.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 sending message to device2 with ip 10.1.2.1.
        Thanks to the 255.255.255.0 mask it understands that device2 is not in the same network, so it send the message to the router that should
            do the job of deliever the message to the correct place in the different subnet, device2.

We have common ips that we asks ourselfes for a subnet:
    1. What is the subnet ip address? - The host portion is zeroes.
    2. What is the first ip address? - The host portion is all zeroes except for the least significant digit which is 1.
    3. What is the last ip address? - The host portion is all ones except for the least significant digit which is 0.
    4. What is the broadcast ip address? - The host portion is all ones.

    Example:
        Answer all the above commmon questions for the next address: 172.16.35.123/20:
        Solution:
            172.16.0010|0011.00111011
            Network     Host
            portion     portion

            subnet address:         172.16.0010|0000.00000000 -> 172.16.32.0
            first ip address:       172.16.0010|0000.00000001 -> 172.16.32.1
            last ip address:        172.16.0010|1111.11111110 -> 172.16.47.254
            broadcast ip address:   172.16.0010|1111.11111111 -> 172.16.47.255
