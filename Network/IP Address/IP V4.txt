IP Address is a layer3 (network) logical address assigned by an administrator.
It is used to identify specific devices on a network.

32 bits - x.x.x.x when x is one byte.
Formed of two portions:
    1. Network ID portion:
        Identifies a specific network.
        Routers maintain routing tables that contain the network
    2. Host address portion:
        Identifies a specific endpint on a network

Class A:
    Starts with binary 0.
    Binary Range:
        0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255

    127 is reserved for the loopback (127.0.0.1)
    0 network is reserved for defalult network (0.1.1.1)
        For both of them you cannot configure static 0ip address.

    Actual Range:
        1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
    Mask:
        255.0.0.0.

    y.x.x.x/8 when y is the network portion and x.x.x is the hosts portion, 8 is the subnet mask.

    Example:
        Sending packet from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.3 will be routed to the same network
        Sending packet from 10.0.0.2 to 11.0.0.2 will be routed to the another network

Class B:
    Starts with binary 10.
    Binary Range:
        128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    Mask:
        255.255.0.0.

    y.y.x.x/16 - when y.y is the network portion and x.x is the hosts portion, 16 is the subnet mask
    Example:
        Sending packet from 128.1.1.2 to 128.1.1.3 will be routed to the same network
        Sending packet from 128.2.1.1 to 128.1.1.1 will be routed to the another network

Class C:
    Starts with binary 110.
    Binary Range:
        192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    Mask:
        255.255.255.0.

    y.y.y.x/24 - when y.y.y is the network portion and x is the hosts portion, 24 is the subnet mask
    Example:
        Sending packet from 192.1.1.2 to 192.1.1.3 will be routed to the same network
        Sending packet from 192.1.1.1 to 192.1.2.1 will be routed to the another network

Class D:
    Starts with binary 1110.
    Binary Range:
        224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

    Class D is a multicast class. It implies that one device is talking to a group of devices rathern than one to one.

Class E:
    Reserved IP addresses.
    Starts with binary 1111
    Binary Range:
        240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Link local addresses:
    When no DHCP (dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server is available, it allocates an ip in the range of 169.254.0.0/16
        (from 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255). That gives the ability to conmunicate with computers in the same subnet but will not be
        routed outside of the network, so communication with devices in different subnet will not be possible.
