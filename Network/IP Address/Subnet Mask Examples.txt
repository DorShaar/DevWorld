Example 1:
    Device1 with IP 10.1.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 sending message to device2 with ip 10.1.2.1.
    Thanks to the 255.255.0.0 mask it understands that device2 is in the same network, so it won't send the message to the router and send it
        directly to device2. It will send ARP message to request the MAC address of device2.

Example 2:
    Device1 with IP 10.1.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 sending message to device2 with ip 10.1.2.1.
    Thanks to the 255.255.255.0 mask it understands that device2 is not in the same network, so it send the message to the router that should
        do the job of deliever the message to the correct place in the different subnet, device2.

Subnet mask are contiguous, meaning it start is bits of only 1's and then ends with bits of only 0s. Mask like 240.255.3.191
    (11110000.11111111.00000110.11000000) is not suppoted.
