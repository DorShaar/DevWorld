netstat - refers network statistics. A command line network utility that displays network connections for TCP, routing tables and number of netowrk interfaces.

A problem I had that I could solve thanks to netstat utility:

	Tried to connect to localhost in port X and got the exception "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it".
	That means the machine it active, but it does not listen on that X port. That means something making that port unreachable.

	In order to check it, I used the "netstat -anb" command which requires run as administrator. I run it and grepped only the "LISTENING" values, since
	the ports with the "ESTABLISHED" status have already an active connections.

	I replaced the port to a one that is open (i.e. has "LISTENING" state) and I could have a progress.

To view routing tables, you can use the command:
	netstat -r
	or
	routep print
