Port is an integer from 0 to 65536 (16 bits long). It indicates a communication endpoint.

It's always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication.

To have better "feeling" what is port, let's the host is a radio and the channel of the radio is the port, listening for recieved data to that channel (port).

Known ports:
80 - HTTP
443 - HTTPS

20 or 21 - FTP (File transfer protocol).
