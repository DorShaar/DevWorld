Port is an integer from 0 to 65536 (16 bits long). It indicates a communication endpoint.

It's always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication.

To have better "feeling" what is port, let's the host is a radio and the channel of the radio is the port, listening for recieved data to that channel (port).

Port is a way to tell the transport level to which application the recieved data is destined. For example, if the port is 80, we actually say that the recieved data is relevant for
    the http application. If the port is 22, we want that ssh application will read that data.

Known ports:
    22 - ssh
    23 - telnet
    80 - HTTP
    443 - HTTPS
    20 or 21 - FTP (File transfer protocol)
