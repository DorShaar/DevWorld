hub:
    Layer1 (Pysical) device.
    get a signal on a specific port and send it to all the connected ports except from the sender port. By doing that it
        amplifies the signal. It can be called multiport repeater.
bridge:
    Layer2 (Data Link) device.
    Has MAC address table which enable to map port to Mac Address, so it sends to the relevant port.
    If the Mac address is empty, it will be updated dynamically, so only when destination port is unknown the signal
        is sent to all unknown ports.
switch:
    Layer2 (Data Link) device.
    get a signal on a specific port and send it to specific port.
    Has MAC address table which enable to map port to Mac Address. They are actually better bridges
        in meanning of speed and number of supported ports.
router:
    Layer3 (Network) device.
    route network traffic from one network to another (from one ip to another ip). Enable us to connect from local area network (LAN) to 
        wide area network (WAN)
