Logic in Ctor's is bad practice. While you intend to create an object which requires long time to take should
not be happening and is a bad practice. Therefore, complex logic or async operations are not recommended to be in Ctors.

What happens if creating an instance of an object requires some initialization which is time consuming? For that I write here
	two simple solutions:
	One thing to do is to start a task that when I need the operation to complete in one of the methods, I wait for it.
	The second option Microsoft added the Lazy option that does the same - Lazy pattern - https://endjin.com/blog/2023/01/dotnet-csharp-lazy-async-initialization.
