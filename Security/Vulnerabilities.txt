Security:
CVE - Common vulnerabilities and exposures.
Weakness is reported to MITRE, which assigned it a csv number. It is used as ID to a weakness.

Cvss - scoring system.

Nvd - national vulnerabilities database.

Two main methods in detecting known vulnerabilities: Pre-build (reading dependancies files) and built apps.
Prebuild might be less accurate, since in complex building situations, different from expected library might be installed. 
In the other hand, in already built apps the vulnerability path cannot be detected.

Vulnerability search must be done on indirect dependencies also.

How to fix a thirs party vulnerability?
1. Upgrade (might be time consuming for testing and checking if newer version exista)
2. Downgrade (same, with knowledge of possible less functionality)
3. Patching - manegment risk if should apply code change or stay with vulnerability.
4. Unmerged Pull-requests - a solution might be found in an open pull-request to an inactive repo.
5. Remove / replace dependency.
6. Dig deeper and fix / block
